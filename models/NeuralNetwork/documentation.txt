This folder contains code used to experiment with different neural network models for cell label prediction.
We are using the new selected 21 features to train the model, and there are 5 classes for the prediction label:[CH, DC, DE, DS, NDC]
NeuralNetwork:
    - NeuralNetwork.py: contains code to train and test the neural network model.
    - Accuracy.txt: contains train and test accuracy of the neural network model using 17439 training samples and 5813 validation samples.
    - model0.7.h5: contains the final saved neural network model.
    - newTraining.data, newTraining_V2.data: training data.
    - train0.7.data: training data used for neural network model. Combined newTraining.data and newTraining_V2.data, and randomly selected 70% of all the combined data as training data.
    - test0.3.data: test data used for neural network model. Combined newTraining.data and newTraining_V2.data, and randomly selected 30% of all the combined data as testing data.
    - result2layer.txt, result3layer.txt, result4layer.txt, result5layer.txt: contains result of experimented neural networks with different number of layers. We found that 3 layer has the highest test accuray.
    - result3layer500epoch.txt: contains train and test accuracy of 3 layer neural network trained with 500 epochs with 16276 training samples and 6976 validation samples.
