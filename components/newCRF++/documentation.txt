This folder contains result of cell label prediction result using the newCRF++ library. We compared the result of using CRF and using neural network and found that
neural network has a higher test accuracy for cell label prediction.
Neural network test accuracy: ~ 95%
CRF test accuracy: 90.267%
We are using 21 features when training the CRF model, and each table cell is predicted to be one of the five labels: [CH, DC, DE, DS, NDC].
We are using the CRF++ library from this website: https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/.

newCRF++:
    - create_train.py: created correct format training data for CRF model. Training data randomly selected 70% of combined data from newTraining.data and newTraining_V2.data.
    - create_test.py: created correct format testing data for CRF model. Training data randomly selected 30% of combined data from newTraining.data and newTraining_V2.data.
    - crf21featureResult.txt: contains the output of the CRF++ model.
    - computeAccuracy.py: code used to compute training accuracy of CRF mode.
    - CRFtrainingresult.txt: contains output of the CRF++ model.
    - CRFprediction.txt: contains prediction result using the 30% of combined data.
    - finalmodel: final saved trained CRF model.
    - template: the template used to run the CRF++ model, used 21 features only.
